# FamilyGenerator
Generator that builds names and ages of family members (for RPGs or Creative Writing)

Written in C# with .NET 5.  Written for RPG game where you play an Italian family in the Renaissance. The program builds names (randomly picking first name and last name) and ages (randomly calculating valid possible age) of family members. Any children with fractional ages are infants.  Childbirth age for women is considered to stop at 40 years old and this impacts the ages of the children.
